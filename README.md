## Welcome to InstaCrumbz, a project clone that we made of Instagram!
## About InstaCrumbz 
InstaCrumbz is a web application inspired by Instagram, with a little twist! 
Our application provides users the ability to post pictures of their finished meals! Upload pictures of your dirty dishes and half eaten meals, and show everyone what you ate during the day.  
The more crumbs the better!
This project mimics Instagram's ability to share and post pictures in an online platform.
